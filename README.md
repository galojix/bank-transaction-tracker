# Bank Transaction Tracker (BTT)
Bank Transaction Tracker (BTT) is a web application for tracking income and
expenditure. It has been developed using Python 3 and the Flask web framework.

## How it Works
* Download your bank transactions as CSV files via your Internet banking
* Upload the CSV files into BTT
* Tell BTT how you want to classify your transactions
* Track income and expenditure using the charts and graphs
* BTT will observe how you classify transactions and learn to do it automatically

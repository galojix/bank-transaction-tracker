# Bank Transaction Tracker (BTT)

Bank Transaction Tracker (BTT) is a web application for tracking income and
expenditure. It has been developed using Python 3 and the Flask web framework.

## How it Works

- Download your bank transactions as CSV files via your Internet banking website
- Upload the CSV files into BTT
- Tell BTT how you want to classify your transactions
- Track income and expenditure using the charts and graphs
- BTT will observe how you classify transactions and learn to do it automatically

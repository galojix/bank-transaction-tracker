# Personal Finance Tracker (PFT)
Personal Finance Tracker (PFT) is a web application for tracking personal
spending and income. It has been developed using Python 3 and the Flask web
framework.

## How it Works
* Download your bank transactions as CSV files via your Internet banking
* Upload the CSV files into PFT
* Tell PFT how you want to classify your transactions
* See how you are spending your hard earned money using the charts and graphs
* PFT will observe how you classify transactions and learn to do it
automatically
